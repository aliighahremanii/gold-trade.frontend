# API Contract Freeze Prompt


You are working inside an existing Next.js App Router frontend repository for a financial gold trading and custody platform.

Important:
- Do not redesign the backend.
- Do not invent backend business rules.
- Do not hand-write API contracts when generated OpenAPI types exist.
- Do not store server-owned financial state as client source of truth.
- Follow AGENTS.md, docs/architecture.md, docs/business-knowledge, and docs/api-contract-strategy.md.
- Keep pages thin; put workflows under src/modules/{module}/flows.
- Use backend-real states. Do not hide pending, failed, expired, manual-review, or unknown states.


## Objective

Create the frontend API contract strategy and generated client workflow from backend OpenAPI documents.

## Business constraints

- The platform starts with XAU/IRR trading.
- Users can deposit IRR, buy gold, hold balances, sell gold, withdraw IRR, and request physical delivery.
- Admins operate manual pricing, market status, approvals, delivery, audit, and reconciliation.
- Backend is the source of truth for price, quote, balance, order, settlement, payment, delivery, and ledger state.

## Deliverables

- Configure API generation.
- Add src/generated/api output.
- Add module-owned query key conventions.
- Add error normalization strategy.
- Add docs/api-contracts/mvp-api-contract-map.md.
- Add CI check for generated client drift if possible.

## Forbidden

- Do not invent endpoints.
- Do not hand-write DTOs that should come from OpenAPI.
- Do not ignore backend problem details.

## Validation

- bun run lint
- bun run typecheck
- bun run test
- bun run build

## Final response

Summarize:

- files changed
- routes/pages added
- modules touched
- API contracts used
- validation commands and results
- assumptions or missing backend contracts
